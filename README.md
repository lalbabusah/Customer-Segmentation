## Introduction
In this project, Segmenting the customer base by service usage patterns.
Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in Segment the customer base.
Using data science to generate a best machine learning model based on these criteria. The advantages of the model will then be clearly expressed so that the best possible solution can be chosen by stakeholders.

## Data Acquisition
Downloaded data from the IBM Cloud object for data analysis.

## Data Wrangling
Used Python Libraries(Pandas, NumPy) on Jupyter notebook platform for data cleaning and preprocessing.

## Data Exploration
Used Python libraries(seaborn) for data visualisation and analysis.

## Model Development
Used Supervised Machine Learning model for Segmenting the customer base.
